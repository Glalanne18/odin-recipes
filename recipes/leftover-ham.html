        <h2>A beautiful finished Leftover ham dish</h2>
        <p>This easy, cheesy ham and potato casserole uses up leftover Christmas or Easter ham! It's perfect for a post-holiday breakfast or an easy weeknight dinner. My family looks forward to this classic combination.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 small potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>7 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 quart milk</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 1 1/2-quart baking dish.</li>
            <li>When the potatoes are almost finished, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add ham and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        </ol>
